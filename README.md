Indoor 3D mapping drone project for UWA Aviation Labs and ANFF.
Design an autonomous indoor drone (no GPS) to scan, hover, and build a 3D map.
Must use two sensors (e.g. LiDAR, ultrasonic), have propeller guards, 1S–2S battery, ≥3 min flight, custom PCB controller, and safety fail-safe (auto-land if signal lost).
Budget ≤ $500. Deliver report, open-source files, and live demo.
